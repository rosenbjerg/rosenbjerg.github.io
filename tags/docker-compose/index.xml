The process was reasonably straight-forward, but finding up-to-date documentation and examples online are always a challenge when the platform moves fast
My Home Assistant needs are covered by just three services; home-assistant , deconz and node-red .

I had been having some issues with the docker-desktop service on Windows, where it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t autostart properly and would start into a broken state where nothing worked. These problems, together with the license change of the docker-desktop product and recommendations to give podman a try, led me to try podman instead.
